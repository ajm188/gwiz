# gwiz

## What is this?

This is my attempt to build a simple webapp in go.
It's basically going to be the barebones "Rails for Zombies" except written in go.
Once I get things into a working state, I plan to play around a _lot_ with the architecture, especially at the database/models interaction layer.
No ORMs! :)

### Why?

I am bored.
I want to learn how.

## Why is it called gwiz?

Well, the "g" comes from the fact that it's written in go.
The "wiz" is a bit more of a stretch that probably offers some insight into how weird my mind is.

Ready?

Rails for Zombies leads me to think about zombies.
Zombies eat brains.
Eating more brains must **surely** make you smarter.
Children that are smart are sometimes called "wiz kids".
Wiz.

## Should you use this?

Absolutely not.

### Can you learn from this?

Maybe?
Time will tell.
